## Chapter I

1. With the **ring of light** from his lantern dancing from side to side he **lurched** across the yard, kicked off his boots at the back door, drew himself a last glass of beer from the barrel in the scullery, and made his way up to bed, where Mrs Jones was already snoring.

2. As soon as the light in the bedroom went out there was **a stirring and a fluttering** all through the farm buildings.

    **flutter vs. stir** verb.
    - stir: to mix a liquid or other substance by moving an object such as a spoon in a circular pattern.
    - flutter: to make a series of quick delicate movements up and down or from side to side, or to cause something to do this.</br></br>

3. Old Major was so **highly regarded** on the farm.

4. He was still a **majestic-looking** pig, with a wise and **benevolent** apperance in spite of the fact that his **tushes** had never been cut.

5. Before long the other animals began to arrive and make themselves comfortable **after their different fashions**.
    - The hens **perched** themselves on the window-sills.
    - The pigeons **fluttered up** to the rafters.
    - The sheep and cows **lay down** behind the pigs and began to **chew the cud**.
    - The two cart-horses, ..., walking very slowly and **setting down their vast hairy hoofs with great care**.
    - **A brood of** ducklings which had lost their mother **filed into** the barn, **cheeping feebly** and wandering from side to side.
    - The mare came **mincing daintly** in, chewing at a lump of sugar.
    - The cat, who looked round, as usual, for the warmest place; there she **purred** contentedly thoughout speech.

6. The two cart-horses, Boxer and Clover, came in together, walking very slowly and setting down their vast hairy hoofs with great care **lest** there should be some small animal **concealed in the straw**.

10. I do not think, comrades, that I shall be with you for many months longer, and before I die I feel it my duty to pass on to you such wisdom as I have acquired.

11. We are born, we are given just **so much food as** will keep the breath in our bodies, and those of us who are capable of **it** are forced to **work to the last atom of our strength**.

12. And **the very instant** that our usefulness has **come to an end** we are slaughtered with **hideous (令人惊骇的)** cruelty.

13. Is it because this land of ours is so poor that it cannot **afford a decent life to** those who **dwell (栖息居住)** upon it?

14. No, comrades, a thousand times no!

15. It is capable of affording food **in abundance** to an **enormously greater** number of animals than now inhabit it.

16. It is summed up in a single word -- Man.

17. Remove Man **from the scene**, and the root cause of hunger and overwork is abolished for ever.

18. Our labour **tills (耕作)** the soil, our dung fertilizes it, and yet there is not one of us owns more than his bare skin.

19. What has happened to that milk which should have been **breeding up** sturdy calves?

20. Who should have been **the support and pleasure of your old age**?

21. In return for your four **confinements (分娩)** and all your labour in the fields, what have you ever had except your bare **rations (配给供应)** and a **stall (畜栏)**?

22. And even the miserable **lives we lead** are not allowed to **reach their natural span**.

23. For myself I do not **grumble (发牢骚)**, for I am one of the lucky ones.

24. To that horror we all must come -- cows, pigs, hens, sheep, everyone.

25. You, Boxer, the very day that those great muscles of yours lose their power, Jones will sell you to the **knacker (屠夫，尤指屠杀不适合食用、无用的牲畜)**, who will cut your throat and **boil you down** for the foxhounds.

26. Is it not crystal clear, then, comrades, that all the **evils** of this life of ours **spring from** the **tyranny (暴政)** of human beings?

27. Your **resolution (决心)** must never **falter （动摇）**. No argument must lead you **astray (迷路)**.

28. At this moment there was a tremendous **uproar (骚动)**.

29. While Major was speaking four large rats had **crept** out of their holes and were sitting on their **hindquarters**, listening to him.

30. The dogs had suddenly **caught sight of** them, and it was only by a swift dash for their holes that the rats saved their lives.

31. Major raised his **trotter（蹄）** for silence.

32. Let us **put it to the vote**.

33. There were only four **dissentients（持不同政见者）**.

34. Remember always your duty of **enmity** towards Man and all his ways. Whatever **goes upon** two legs is an enemy. Whatever goes upon four legs, or has wings, is a friend.

35. And remember also that in fighting against Man, we must not come to **resemble** him. Even when you have conquered him, do not adopt his **vices**.

36. I had known that tune **in my infancy**, but it had **long since（早就）** **passed out of my mind**.

37. And what is more, the words of the song also came back -- words, I am certain, which were sung by the animals **of long ago** and have been **lost to memory** for generations.

38. The singing of this song **threw the animals into the wildest excitement**.

39. After a few preliminary tries, the whole farm burst into 'Beasts of England' in tremendous **unison （齐唱）**.

40. The cows **lowed** it, the dogs **whined** it, the sheep **bleated** it, the horses **whinnied** it, the ducks **quacked** it.

41. They were so delighted with the song that they sang it right **through five times** **in succession**, and might have continued singing it all night if they had not been interrupted.
