## Chapter I

1. With the **ring of light** from his lantern dancing from side to side he **lurched** across the yard, kicked off his boots at the back door, drew himself a last glass of beer from the barrel in the scullery, and made his way up to bed, where Mrs Jones was already snoring.

2. As soon as the light in the bedroom went out there was **a stirring and a fluttering** all through the farm buildings.

    **flutter vs. stir** verb.
    - stir: to mix a liquid or other substance by moving an object such as a spoon in a circular pattern.
    - flutter: to make a series of quick delicate movements up and down or from side to side, or to cause something to do this.</br></br>

3. Old Major was so **highly regarded** on the farm.

4. He was still a **majestic-looking** pig, with a wise and **benevolent** apperance in spite of the fact that his **tushes** had never been cut.

5. Before long the other animals began to arrive and make themselves comfortable **after their different fashions**.
    - The hens **perched** themselves on the window-sills.
    - The pigeons **fluttered up** to the rafters.
    - The sheep and cows **lay down** behind the pigs and began to **chew the cud**.
    - The two cart-horses, ..., walking very slowly and **setting down their vast hairy hoofs with great care**.
    - **A brood of** ducklings which had lost their mother **filed into** the barn, **cheeping feebly** and wandering from side to side.
    - The mare came **mincing daintly** in, chewing at a lump of sugar.
    - The cat, who looked round, as usual, for the warmest place; there she **purred** contentedly thoughout speech.

6. The two cart-horses, Boxer and Clover, came in together, walking very slowly and setting down their vast hairy hoofs with great care **lest** there should be some small animal **concealed in the straw**.
